# Backport of std::filesystem submodule for the asap project

See https://github.com/abdes/asap for a functional minimal starter project
that uses this submodule.

This submodule is not intended to be used alone. Instead, refer to the [asap
project](https://github.com/abdes/asap) for the recommended container project
to fully leverage this submodule and add other libraries/executables/etc... to
the top level project.
